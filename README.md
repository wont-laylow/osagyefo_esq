## ðŸ“œ About the Project

Many Ghanaians are unaware of their legal rights, especially concerning tenancy, employment, healthcare, and justice. Osagyefo AI aims to close this gap by answering legal questions in simple, understandable language â€” empowering people to make informed decisions.

> "Ignorance of the law is no excuse â€” but access to legal understanding should be a right."
